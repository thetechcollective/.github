# Do your internship with us or become a Junior Developer

**Our community is for joint development of prodcuts and features. But it is _also_ a carefully designed training field - a _dojo_ where you can come and do your _katas_. 
Read on if you are studying a relevant topic at either B.Sc. or M.Sc. level and you are looking for either a full time internship or a student job.**

In The Tech Collective we're facinated by the concept of building quality in - as opposed to try to glue it on to the product after it's released. This concept is not new at all. It's an ideal mentioned in the _Agile Manifesto_. It's the core of _Continious Delivery_ and the _DevOps Culture_. And it's why we strive for _Automated testing_ - well, why we strive for _Automation_ in general.

## Anything as Code
We belive in _anything as code._  

If _whetever you're trying to achieve_ can be solved by a snippet of software, then your solution is software. It's code! And we know how to deal with code:

**When code is done right:**
- It's programmable
- It's immutable
- It's semantically version controlled
- It's automatically tested
- It's documented
- It's componentized and dependecies are managed
- It's released as packages
- It's maintained

Alright, this may not sound like a big deal. But it is!. If we turn up the ambition a notch or two and claim that the properties mentioned above are not optional - they are required. The we enter into a quite complex field of software. We're not merely _programming_ or _hacking_ anymore. Now we have to deal with the entire eco-system that surrounds code. 

...as code!

## One-piece-flow

When Toyota faced the problem of building quality cars with small means, with scarcity of basically all ressources, including funding, and entering into a playingfield where the competition at that time was 1000s times better prepared than themselves, they took an entirely new appraoach that has inspired the world, and especially the software industry ever since; The _Toyota Production System (TPS)_ or _lean_ as it was called when used outside Toyota's own sphere. 

They were the ones who came up with the ideal to build quality in - as opposed to glue quality on. The Japanese word is _"jidoka"_.  And one of the core principles they applied to achived this was _"kaizen"_ - Continious Improvement and _"kanban"_ -  Signaling.

In _Continuous Delivery_, _DevOps_ and _Automated testing_ we're espacially inspired by Toyota's one-piece-flow. Toyota built an assembly-line that was deliberately designed to make problems surface immidiately. They would not build individual components for stock - and then later assemble them. Instead the would organize the assembly belt so that in the start there was nothing - and in the end there was a finished Toyota, ready to be shipped of to the customer. At the time, this approach was definitly not considered the most effecient way to build cars - but is should proof that it was definitely the most effective (the suttle destincion between _effecient_ and  _effective_ is deliberate!).

It had a huge effect! A lot of problems surfaced. All the time. In fact so many, that in the beginning they had a hard time delivering cars at all. Most of the time the factory was at a stand-still; fixing problems in the one-piece-flow through means of _kaizen_ - continious improvement and reorganizing the tasks to adhere to the concept of _kanban_ - signalling.

The story of The Toyota Way has many more nuances than described in the three paragraphs above - But for now it's sufficinet to make our point to note that a holistic view based on system thinking and problem solving is also at the core of how we work. And The Toyta Way is defineitly worth diving deep into.  

## Enter our dojo - do some katas

The field we're entering can be refered to as _Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)_ management or by terms such as _Continuous Delivery_ and _DevOps_ and no matter by what term we name it, it's build on the same one-piece-flow mindsat as Toyota introduced. In realty though; this is complex - by nature probably even more complex than building a car, due to the inheretly untangible nature of software.
