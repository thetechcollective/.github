#### Welcome to The Tech Collective's community at GitHub. We are a **tribe** of agile teams with a passion for utilizing technology and digital solutions to drive **meaningful** outcomes. We are a **collective** of technologists, developers, testers, engineers, designers and enthusiasts who love to share our knowledge and experience with others.

We are building a community of **open source** and **free** products ‚Äî such as **extensions, CLI‚Äôs, Plugins, GitHub Actions, Templates, Workflows** etc. that are related to **Automation, Internal Development Platforms (IDP), Platform Engineering (PE), Developer Experience (DX) and Cyber Security**.

Our goal is to create **useful and innovative** tools and features that can help developers and engineers work more **effectively**. We also **aim** to foster a **collaborative and inclusive** environment where everyone can learn from each other and contribute to the **common good**.
