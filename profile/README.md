#### Welcome to The Tech Collective, a community of agile teams with a passion for utilizing technology and digital solutions to drive meaningful outcomes. We are a collective of technologysts, developers, testers, engineers, designers and enthusiasts who love to share our knowledge and experience with others.

We are building a community of open source and free products that are related to Automation, Internal Development Platforms, Platform Engineering and Developer Experience. Examples could be git extensions, GitHub CLI extensions, GitHub Actions, etc.

Our goal is to create useful and innovative tools that can help developers and engineers work more efficiently and effectively. We also aim to foster a collaborative and inclusive environment where everyone can learn from each other and contribute to the common good.
